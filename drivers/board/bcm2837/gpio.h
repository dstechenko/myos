/**
 * There are 54 general-purpose I/O (GPIO) lines split into two banks. All GPIO
 * pins have at least two alternative functions within BCM. The alternate
 * functions are usually peripheral IO and a single peripheral may appear in
 * each bank to allow flexibility on the choice of IO voltage. The GPIO
 * peripheral has three dedicated interrupt lines. These lines are triggered by
 * the setting of bits in the event detect status register. Each bank has itsâ€™
 * own interrupt line with the third line shared between all bits. The Alternate
 * function table also has the pull state (pull-up/pull-down) which is applied
 * after a power down.
